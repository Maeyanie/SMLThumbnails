# SMLThumbnails
Windows Explorer thumbnails for SML files.  

Not very polished and quite manual at the moment. Windows doesn't make it easy.  

There's binary DLLs available, download the appropriate one for your CPU and register it by running:  
`regsvr32 \path\to\SMLThumbnails.dll`

You can remove it later by running:  
`regsvr32 /u \path\to\SMLThumbnails.dll`
